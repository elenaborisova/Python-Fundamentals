## **01.	Trains** [Soltion](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/09.%20Lists%20Advanced%20-%20Lab/01_trains.py)
You will receive how many wagons the train has. Create a list with that length with all zeros. Until you receive the command "End", you get some of the following commands:  
•	add {people} -> adds the people in the last wagon  
•	insert {index} {people} -> adds the people at the given wagon  
•	leave {index} {people} -> removes the people from the wagon  
After you receive the "End" command print the train  


## **02.	Todo List** [Soltion](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/09.%20Lists%20Advanced%20-%20Lab/02_to_do_list.py)
You will receive a todo-notes until you get the command "End". The notes will be in the format: "{importance}-{value}". Return the list of todo-notes sorted by importance. The maximum importance will be 10


## **03.	Palindrome Strings** [Soltion](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/09.%20Lists%20Advanced%20-%20Lab/03_palindrome_strings.py)
Write a program that receives on the first line words separated by a space and a searched palindrome on the second. Print all the palindromes on the first line. Print all the occurrences of the searched palindrome in the format: "Found palindrome {count} times"


## **04.	Even Numbers** [Soltion](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/09.%20Lists%20Advanced%20-%20Lab/04_even_numbers.py)
Write a program that reads a single string with numbers separated by comma and space ", ". Print the indices of all even numbers


## **05.	The Office** [Soltion](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/09.%20Lists%20Advanced%20-%20Lab/05_the_office.py)
You Will Receive Two Lines of Input: a List of Employee's Happiness As String with Numbers Separated by a Single Space and a Happiness Improvement Factor (Single Number). Your Task is to Find Out If the Employees Are Generally Happy in Their Office. To Do That You Have to Increase Their Happiness by Multiplying the All the Employee's Happiness (the Numbers from the List) by the Factor, Filter the Employees Which Happiness is Greater Than or Equal to the Average in the New List and Print the Result  
There are two types of output:  
•	If the half or more of the employees have happiness >= than the average: "Score: {happy_count}/{total_count}. Employees are happy!"  
•	Otherwise: "Score: {happy_count}/{total_count}. Employees are not happy!"
