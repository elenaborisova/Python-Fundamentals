## **01.	Binary Digits Count** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/01_binary_digits_count.py)
You are given a positive integer number and one binary digit B (0 or 1). Your task is to write a program that finds the number of binary digits (B) in given integer.


## **02.	Bit at Position 1** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/02_first_bit.py)
Write a program that prints the bit at position 1 of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.


## **03.	P-th Bit** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/03_pth_bit.py)
Write a program that prints the bit at position p of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.


## **04.	Bit Destroyer** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/04_bit_destroyer.py)
Write a program that sets the bit at position p to 0. Print the resulting integer.


## **05.	* Odd Times** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/05_odd_times.py)
You are given an array of positive integers in a single line, separated by a space (' '). All numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find it, using only bitwise operations.


## **06.	* Tri-bit Switch** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/19.%20Bitwise%20Operations/06_tri_bit_switch.py)
Write a program that inverts the 3 bits from position p to the left with their XOR opposites (e.g. 111 -> 000, 101 -> 010) in 32-bit number. Print the resulting integer on the console.
